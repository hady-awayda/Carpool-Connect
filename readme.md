> Carpool Connect is a platform designed to optimize urban mobility by connecting users with matching schedules and routes, and facilitating communication between them.
>
>  The platform allows users to create personalized schedules, automatically find the best route matches based on proximity and travel times, and share rides with others, promoting convenience, cost-saving, and eco-friendly commuting.
>
> The ultimate goal is to reduce commute times, save transportation costs, and promote a greener urban environment.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
